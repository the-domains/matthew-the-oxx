# Poetry is...

Words and words, an ever-flowing cascade of, dreams...

### I reckon summer [clicks][0] away... 

Mining effort's quartered tone

I writhe at how we mustered

Pink royal floaters

Camping, a biker nest

Is flabby joy too loud and resting stammers play?

Clip is sheathed on lint

I reckon summer clicks away
